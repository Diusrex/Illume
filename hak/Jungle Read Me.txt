How I made this Jungle and Credits to all original author's

1) Jackal combine Yumi Chan's water, Thallions Hills&Homes and DLA's Canopy.
2) I reskinned Jackal's workusing Baron Rage's Junlge textures.
3) I edited all the falling leaves out of the mdl's and also made many of the DLA canopies fadable.
4) I edited many tiles adding Charlies's Lush Bushes and Shadowlvl's ferns.
5) I then combined and reskinned Acropoles Forte de Hombrev2 into the Jungle and edited the edge 2da and translated the set and itp to English (A daunting task).
6) I added some_ux's airships, caravel and carrack editing some mdls and changing the water height.
7) I added my custom mdl's fallen log, walkthrough tree and suspension bridge (which is a remake of Blood Monkey's 1x5 version).
8) I reskinned Fantu's lion using Nencraban's lion portrait.
9) I added Shadowlvl's Vine creatures.
10) I combined some Jungle sounds to add addition atmosphere from sound dog. 
11) Finally I added Lord Sullivan's awesome Myan pyramid reskinned with a complimentary ruined stair by racerblue.

AS you can see I did a horde of editing and combination work but the real credit belongs to the entire comunity. Without the comunity this hak would have never happened.


Enjoy!
