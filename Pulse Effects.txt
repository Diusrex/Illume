Effect Tag: "beacon"
    Requirements: The object MUST NOT BE STATIC (placeables are this by default).
    Effect: Object will light up upon first pulse. When pulsed it will emit a pulse and hum for a period of time. Will emit a mini-pulse if currently making sound.
    Variables:
        time -> float, will be the length of time until it can be pulsed again, should be slightly longer than length of sound.
        color -> string, will be the color that the mushroom should be lit up.

Effect Tag: "note"
    Requirements: The object MUST NOT BE STATIC (placeables are this by default).
    Effect: Object will light up upon first pulse. When pulsed it will emit a pulse and play a note. Will emit a mini-pulse if currently making sound.
    Variables:
        time -> float, will be the length of time until it can be pulsed again, should be slightly longer than length of sound.

Effect Tag: "drum", or "double", or "triple", or "bunch"
    Requirements: The object MUST NOT BE STATIC (placeables are this by default).
    Effect: Object will light up upon first pulse. When pulsed it will emit a pulse and pick a sound from a set to play, and use that
            sound for all future pulses. Will emit a mini-pulse if pulsed quickly after previous pulse.
    Variables:
        color -> string, will be the color that the mushroom should be lit up.

Effect Tag: "scannable"
    Requirements: The object MUST NOT BE STATIC (placeables are this by default). The object's tag must be "scannableObject".

                  be "Audio Log #", where "#" is the same as the variable "log_number" (described below).
    Effect: Will play an audio log sound file.
    Variables:
        log_number -> int, the number of the audio log file to play.
        time -> float, an amount a little bit larger than the length of the audio file, to prevent file from being played on top of itself.
